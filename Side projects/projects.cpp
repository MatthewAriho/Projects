//write a piece of code that calculates the cube root of some input without using any of the standard function (precision to 0.0001)
//*write a program to check if input is an anadrome( word if any of its anagrams is a palindrome- word which reads the same backwards as forward e.g madam)
//write code to look for a strange root( if its square and root share any digit e.g 11 and 121 share 1)
//goldbach's conjecture(every even number greater than two can be expressed as the sum of two primes), find all combinations for a given input (one or more)- input could be 4 or 4,8 which means(4,6,8)
//*base converter, input in the form - number(space) base
/*/a lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime numbers is still one of its divisors e.g 8- 2 is a prime divisior, 4 is also a divisor, 50- 5 is a prime divisor, 25 is also a divisor
